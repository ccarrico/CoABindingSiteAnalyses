# Uploads in Progress!
# Code deposition for "Coenzyme A binding sites induce proximal acylation across protein families"

Final contents:
* Code and input files to analyze enrichment of CoA-binding proteins (CoABPs) in MS datasets
* Homology models of mouse CoABPs used for modeling
* Code to generate a Coenzyme A structural ensemble, align it to homology models of CoABPs, and score modeled lysines by CoA accessibility
